          <p class="company">The company "Space Tour" originates from the beginning of the 21st century. The company's initial goal was to explore nearby planets. But with the development of space tourism, our technology has made it possible for everyone to experience unforgettable travel experiences. Currently, the company is the leader in terms of the number of flights. Far in the past are those times when the most remote distances were limited only to our Earth. Now you can diversify your vacation by visiting the orbits of the planets of the solar system and enjoy incredible views.</p>

The development of new engines will reduce the time spent on the way to distant objects. Using the new engines, we plan to explore more distant objects in our solar system from Saturn to Pluto.
